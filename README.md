## Welcome to my humble abode ðŸ‘‹

My single minded purpose is to leverage Deep Learning and Computer Vision in the following domains

Aerospace, Astronomy, Aeronautics, Astronautics, Aviation, Biomedicine, Geospatial Intelligence, Earth Observation, Ocean Intelligence, Coastal Intelligence, Atmosphere Science, Medical Imaging, Neuroimaging, Neuroscience, Satellite Imaging, Wildlife/Marine conservation, Solar/Wind/Atmosphere/Air/Weather/Climate forecasting, Underwater Imaging, UAVs, ROVs, Defence, Maritime Intelligence, Healthcare Science, Meterology, Biology, DNA, RNA sequencing, Gene Sequencing, Precision Agriculture/ Crop/ Aquaponics/ Aquaculture/ Vertical Farming / Fish Farming/ Fish feeding/ Horticulture, Ecosystem / Biodiversity/ Coral reefs, IVF, Fertility, Embryo, Cosmetics, Retail, Fashion, Oil Spill/ Wildfire, Autonomous Driving, Air/land/sea/ocean Traffic analysis/monitoring, Nulcear, Vegetaion Intelligence, Arctic & Antartica research on global warming, Renewable energy, Smart Wearables, Drones, Environment, Remote Sensing, neurofeedback, neurostimulation, eeg based brain wearables, neurophotobiomodulation, light therapy, brain computer interface, neuromorphing, neuroenhancement, brain sensing, neural implants, PEMF therapy, haptic feedback, brain wearables, neuro headbands.

Upcoming LinkedIn posts

1) ANN(Artificial Neural Network) vs Biological Neural Network(BNN)

2) Deep Learning V/S Computer Vision V/S Image Processing

3) Image Classification v/s Image Segmentation v/s Object Detection v/s Instance Segmentation

4) Neural Network(Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron)

5) Convolution Neural Network

6) Transposed convolution and Dilated Convolution

7) Feature extraction layers and fully connected layers

8) Weights and biases, matrix calculation + activation function purely math based

9) How computer undestand images compared to human brain? More breakdown on image and interpretation by human brain and computer

10) Understanding Bounding boxes, Non maximum suppression, IoU, multiple anchors

11) Marine Image v/s Underwater imaging v/s satellite imaging v/s medical imaging v/s aerial imagery, Infrared

12) Audio and signal

13) Explore various data augmentation/transformation and data preprocessing techniques required by either of the above imagery(6, 7) to build a diverse/versatile dataset for shaping best model

14) Inference on Jetson Tx2

15) Conversion of TF model to TF-TRT model

16) Deployment Docker GCP, AWS, Azure deployment + streamlit webapp

17) Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning

I am highly interested in image classification, image segmentation, instance segmentation and object detection where it could be applied to image/video based dataset
